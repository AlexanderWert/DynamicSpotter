#1 - low - TestDetection option in hirarchy
The TestDetection option in the hirarchy of DS is loaded with a delay (150ms?) into
the optionbox after clicking on "add" in the hirarchy.xml.

#2 - low - Hirarchy is a configuration, too
Why is the Hierarchy no in the configuration part? This is confusing. Of course it does not
need to be set by the user, but it still is a configuration.

#3 - low - context menu to open items
Add a the options "Open" and "Open with" in the context menu for each file. It will
help users to open the file, when they don't realize to double-click on it.

#4 - low - Spotter config below Workload adapter
Please put the Spotter Config configuration file below the workload adapter.

#5 - low - rename history to result
History is confusing, because one does not expect the most recent results there.



#6 - low - format History entries
Format the history entries to have readable format. E.g. "DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS"

#7 - low - omitExperiments
a dropdown box for omitting experiment is more intuitive then clicking on a text field for a boolean
to trigger it.

#8 - high - Path to dummyData
The path to dummy data is not correctly parsed. The "/" on the paths are missing after selecting the data.

#8 - mid - Application shutdown when hierarchy missing
Add a check if at least one entry is in the hierarchy and stop if there is none. Currently the application
explodes when the hierarchy is absent but DS executed.

#9 - low - Rename hiearchy to "Detection hierarchy"
One expects a list beyond hierarchy when seeing it. It is confusing to double-click it
to edit it.

#10 - low - Default satellites names
Change the default satellites names to something more useful. E.g. "Spotter Satellite Extension" in measurement environment
to "Spotter measurement controller".

#11 - low - Satellites with same name
Append "(1)" "(2)" and so forth when the name of the satellite is already taken. But just focus on the current
view. So don't say "Spotter Satellite Extension (1)" in MeasCon, when there is a "Spotter Satellite Extension"
in the InstrContr list.

#12 - low - name of the open file
It might be possible to change the open file name to be diffrent than "mEnv.xml". It is "mEnv.xml" for the InstrControl, 
MeasurContro and WorkAda configuration. I know all the options are in one file, but I would appreciate a tab
naming like:
"Instrumentation Controllers"
"Measurement Controllers"
"Workload Adapater"
If this is not possible, please rename "mEnv.xml" to "satellites.xml". This would be fine, too.

#13 - low - name of satellites for MeasCon and InstuCon same
There is a dynamic instrumentation satellite. The best choice would be to leave the word "dynamic" away. This is
confusing, especially because there is the exact same configuration for a measurement satellite, which cannot be
dynamic. But actually the measurement satellites can receive updated measurement information, too.

#14 - low - filter jmeter result file to *.csv
The jmeter result file must be in csv ending. The file must not exists before running the experiment!

#15 - low - filter jmeter scenario file to *.jmx
The jmeter scenario file must be in jmx ending.

#16 - low - Jmeter root dir is actually the bin dir
Change the field information and name to workload.jmeter.bin,workload.jmeter.bin.dir or equal.

#17 - high - UI load extensions at startup
When directly executing experiment after starting the UI, an exception is thrown concering the extension loading.
So, once the extensions MUST be loaded at starting.

#18 - low - SUT warmup duration
Enable the possiblity to set the SUT warmup duration, which is currently hardcoded in AbstractDetectionController.SUT_WARMPUP_DURATION.







#19 - low - fix bugs concerning shutdown of the spotter service server

The org.spotter.service.ServerLauncher throws a ConnectException when the server is shutdown before any request has been performed:
Exception in thread "main" com.sun.jersey.api.client.ClientHandlerException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect

#20 - normal - provide general information/description about different performance problems
Currently there is no description provided for the different performance problems that could be displayed to the user in the UI.
